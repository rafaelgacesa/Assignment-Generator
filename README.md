Instructions for use of Molecular Genetics Assignment Generator:

1. Fill in the "LongAnswerQuestions.txt" file with the options for the
long answer questions. Each question should be on a new line (separated
by clicking ENTER)

2. Fill in the "TrueFalseQuestions.txt" file with the options for the
true or false questions. Each question should be followed by a tab
(press tab on keyboard) and then a single letter for the answer
(Either 'T' or 'F'). Then, on a new line (click ENTER) should be the
next question. 

3. Fill in the "names.txt" file with the a class list. This should
be in the format "Firstname Lastname" (separated by a space). Each 
name should be on a new line. 

NOTE: For Steps 1, 2, and 3, make sure that there are no extra lines
at the bottom of the text file after the question bank or names are
filled in.

4. Click the "GeneticsAssignment.jar" file and wait until a folder
opens. The assignments, as well as the answers will be generated in 
this folder. Once you have these made, it is recommended that you move 
these to another folder, as each time the program is run, the folder 
will be cleared and there is no way to access these deleted files again.
